I am a Ghanaian soldier, 55 and a web developer. I undertook a diploma course in computer programming after secondary school in the early 90s. Since then, I have taught myself through a lot of reading, research and practice. I joined University of the People to formalize my knowledge to fit well into the IT industry. The tuition free leaning at University of the People showed me a light at the end of the tunnel, as my salary is not enough to afford a dull fee-paying university. University of the People offers me the training and challenges required to earn a real degree. You get free textbooks, industry professionals as instructors and a global community of students and staff for a perfect learning experience. I will encourage everyone who wants a university degree but cannot afford the cost to try University of the People. But since UoPeople is definitely not a "degree mill", I will warn anyone that it requires determination, hardwork, dedication and self-motivation to earn a degree at UoPeople.
